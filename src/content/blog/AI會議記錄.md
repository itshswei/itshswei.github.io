## test
在廚房裡，我著手進行泡牛奶的儀式。輕巧的塑膠奶瓶（我們試用過三種，才找到這個合用的樣式，大得足以配合他不夠靈敏的動作技巧，卻又輕得讓他能夠牢牢握住），經濟包的大罐美強生（這種散裝給人的感覺挺沮喪的，裡頭含帶許多暗示的意味），以單手巍巍顫顫地滴定幾小茶匙的寶寶樂和燕麥（他能吸入稀薄的液體，我們花了幾個月時間才找出這種一定比例，調配出固定的濃度。我的腦袋裝滿了數字：劑量、溫熱次數、排便頻率、抓撓、哭泣、小寐。）寶寶樂遍灑的粉末形成一片無所不在的薄膜，勾起了每每在夜裡襲來的痛楚：我們是否能再度擁有井然有序的生活？而第二陣痛楚則是因為有這種念頭而引發的羞愧感。我在老是堆疊如山的碗盤瀝水架（我們總是洗個不停，一根量管、一個皮下注射器、一個瓶子，或者是一只量藥杯）之間翻找奶嘴（要正確的那只奶嘴，我在前端加大X型吸孔，讓濃稠的液體能順利流出）和塑膠奶嘴蓋。將奶嘴塞進杯子裡，當它密合地嵌入，會發出令人安心的「波」一聲。還有那使睪丸萎縮的微波爐。

In this paper, we explore maternal shame and guilt as affective derivatives of social regulations of motherhood in Iceland, which is internationally perceived as a frontrunner in gender equality. We analyze 450 qualitative questionnaires completed by parents describing feelings of guilt and shame in connection to parenthood. We use 76 questionnaires completed by fathers to contrast and compare to answers from mothers to better understand the affective‐discursive workings of motherhood. The affective‐discursive analytical framework allows us to understand affective pulls, pushes, power dynamics and their social politics. The findings are contextualized in the Nordic welfare state, neoliberalism, the current ethos of intensive mothering. The recurrent thread running through the data is the idea of the ever‐present mother, and under this umbrella concept, we have developed two affective‐discursive themes: (i) the guilt of working (long hours) and having to arrange for childcare and (ii) failing to be 100% present for the child. We conclude that the emotions of guilt and shame are consistently present in mothers' lives, much more so than in fathers' lives, and that this gendered pattern is both caused by and serves to reinforce the age‐old cultural mandate that mothers are primarily responsible for child rearing. The marks of intensive mothering are evident in mothers' description of feeling guilty for everyday tasks such as working, cleaning, studying, arranging for daycare, sending their children to preschool, and attending to their own needs. This gendered pattern suggests that the gender equality cornerstone of the Nordic welfare state might be at risk as important institutions, such as preschools, are perceived as inferior to mothers' constant attention.
